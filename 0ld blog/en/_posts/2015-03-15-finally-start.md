Now I worked over a month on the design of this diary. 
Actually I wanted to make a blog for my internship in Kazakhstan in July 2014, but because I also like to do web design I wanted to create my blog from scratch. 
So I sat in our 9m<sup>2</sup> office and read about wordpress and how to make a template for it instead of *just* creating a tumblr account and start writing. Back in Germany my new Flatmate Philipp told me about jekyll, which is a static site generator. 
Hmm... I heard that before, in a Web Basics seminar we looked at [kirby](http://getkirby.com/).

__But what is the advantage of [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)?__ 

* It's open source and everything open source is good! (and free)
* It creates your Website. You just give it a neatly sorted template and some markdown files and jekyll does the rest
* You can host it on [GitHub](http://github.com). Free Webspace, if it is ok for you that everybody else can see your code 
* Very Simple and easy to learn

It took me a couple of days to sort of understand what jekyll and GitHub does. I started to build my page 3 times from the beginning, and finally gave in and downloaded [Philipps](http://hey.kleinfreund.de) Website and looked how it is build. Thank you MIT Licensing!

More than one month later I finally know how his (and now my) website works and I am fairly happy with the design. A couple bugs must be fixed and some features will be added, but it works for now and I can finally start writing!

I am not quite sure what I will post here, but I will reflect on my personal life and my interests here.
