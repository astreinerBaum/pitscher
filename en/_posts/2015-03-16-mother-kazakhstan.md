### Before going abroad
First a little bit about the ASA-Program which supports young people, who want to engage and participate in a global and sustainable world. It is a governmental learning program with a 3 month internship abroad.
After applying for an Internship the ASA-Program provides their participants with two mandatory seminars. These Seminars give you a wide variety of knowledge concerning global disparities, ethnic differences, the impact of colonization and some information about the country you will go to.
Of course 2 weeks can not go very deep into all those topics, but give you a basic understanding about the problematics and the tools to find out more by yourself. Probably the best thing is to meet other people with a lot of different interests and backgrounds. At the first seminar I met my „tandem-partner“, the person who I would share three month of my life with in Kazakhstan, which is why I will often use plural forms in this text from now on.
From the very beginning me and my tandem partner got extremely well along with each other.
The discussions at the seminars were extremely interesting, mind bending and in the end you come out as a new person, or at least you need a while to process everything after you come back to „regular“ society.
After coming back from the seminars means preparing to go away.
Contacting the organization EcoObraz was not hard, first we contacted our supervisor Mariya Savitskaya over E-Mail, then Skype and at the end (of course) facebook.
Getting a visa is for sure the hardest part to prepare for the trip. Unfortunately there is no Visa for Volunteers, so we had to get a Business visa which meant for us that we have to get out of the country every 4 weeks. This was generally no problem. We took the train or bus to Almaty or directly to Bishkek. Unfortunately on our last re-entry the border police gave us only one stamp, so we had to get a second stamp at the immigration office in our city, but they were closed on the fifth day, when we arrived in Karaganda. This meant for us that we had to pay around 120€ penalty.  

### Arriving

To get my visa I had to drive to Berlin and give the embassy my passport and the filled out documents. I got my passport (with my visa in it) back on the same day my flight went, which was a little bit risky but I made sure everything is ok over the telephone. I packed my stuff, made sure everything is done for university, where we had a last exhibition the weekend before I took the flight and the next thing I remember is sitting in the plane to Moscow and suddenly lots of russian speaking people.My parents are Germans who lived in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan in Soviet Russian times. At home they speak russian with each other, but to me they only spoke german. I never really had the urge to learn russian, when I was younger because I thought I would never need it. I took a university course for a year to learn the language, when I was 21 because I wanted to explore where my parents come from.There is a huge difference between learning languages in university and actually speaking or understanding it. In the airplane I could understand snippets of sentences people around me would say and I could order tomato juice and coffee in russian by repeating what other people ordered. I was extremely cautious to choose words I understand and don’t get hung up in conversations I couldn’t take, because I wanted to “fit in”. After a long time in planes and airports I arrived in Karaganda airport at 5am in the morning with a big grin on my face, eager to find out what is happening in the next 3 months. Going threw the border station was no problem even though I was very anxious in the beginning, because my parents told me that one of our friends who went to Kazakhstan had to bribe them with euros to get access. The officer was friendly and fast. I just had to fill out a small paper, who invited me and what my purpose of the visit is. 
Maria told me there would be someone who picks me up at 6am so I went outside and had a cigarette. I went back in to get some money at an ATM, which it wouldn’t give to me. There was some kind of error with my credit card. (Apparently no money on it) 
After a while the airport was completely empty. It was only me and some taxi drivers. One of them approached me outside to ask for a cigarette and we did a little bit of smalltalk and he went off. But another one really wanted to drive me somewhere. I told him I will get picked up. He asked where I need to go. I told him the name of the organization. He called people if they knew where “EcoObraz“ is. Nobody knew. He still tried to convince me to drive me somewhere. I told him I had no money and at that point Alexandra arrived. Alexandra (Sasha) will be my coworker for the next 3 months. She is about the same age then me, finished her university courses and started working for the NGO when she was 16. She barely speaks english so I had to explain her everything in my very broken russian. We went to her place, figured out what was wrong with my credit card, went grocery shopping, played cards and had a nap. It was sunny and all in all it was a pretty amazing first day. At night Alexandra called a couchsurfer I had talked to before I got to Kazakhstan and ordered a taxi so i can get there. Nazym lives with her mother in Maikuduk which is a small satellite city of Karaganda and it was formerly known for violence and drinking, but I never encountered any of that there.Nazym showed me around the city the next day and we went to Timur, a friend of Masha where we could stay for two weeks in his living room. 

### Daily Routine / Work

After Matthäus, my tandem partner, arrived we started working in the office. Masha introduced us to everyone. The office is quite small, which is usually no problem because there are only 4-5 people working regularly, but with us it meant that we had to squeeze in a bit.  
 
<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/branchfree/16660102068" title="Office EcoObraz by Matthias Pitscher, on Flickr"><img class="img--center" src="https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7601/16660102068_286aa2976c.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="Office EcoObraz"></a>

Working hours were usually from 10am to 6pm with an hourly break, but depending on the circumstances we could get days off or come later / go earlier. Masha explained that they recently went to illegal waste dumps and documented the pollution of the surrounding waters and that right now there is summer vacation for schools so they don’t go to schools to educate, but they are planning an “action” to go to a public space and educate passengers about the problem of polluting water with illegal waste dumps. She told me that I can do a poster for recycling and Matthäus can prepare a presentation how recycling in Germany works. 
I tried to explain to her that I am not usually an Illustrator, but I can try my best. In my opinion posters for kids work best if they are underlined by strong characters. 
After doing some sketches and trying out some methods and showing them to Masha it came out that “recycling“ is to broad of a topic to make a poster out of it. She decided to advertise orange bins where one can put ecological lamps and batteries in. I worked around 3-4 weeks on the illustration and arrangement. It is a green monster-like figure saying the catchphrase “I KNOW where to put my old lamps and batteries“. We decided to make it postcard sized and leave a blank space where you can put in a location of the nearest bin. Then we helped to put up the “action“ outside. Alongside with the action there was a talk and discussion about problems they have with waste in Kazakhstan. I took photographs and edited them to put up on social media. We also talked to a TV journalist about our work in Karaganda. The upcoming weeks were a little bit diverse. We went to Kyrgyzstan for a week and afterwards to an Ecological Festival in Almaty where we volunteered. After we came back there was not really much to do.
Masha told us that she is leaving for Honeymoon soon and gave us a little bit of work. I got a design inspiration to make an interactive Poster for pupils. The Idea was to have two posters and set of stickers. On the stickers their are different kinds of waste and materials.The posters consist of a timeline separated into 5 categories and different garbage cans where children can separate the waste-stickers into. Despite working on that for quite a long time, even after coming back to Germany, I worked on a facebook event page and did more journalistic photography for the NGO on their Actions.
In the beginning of the internship me and Masha talked about making a short film / advertisement, which unfortunately never got realized. This would have been quite a challenge, because I had almost no video equipment and no capable crew with me, but it would have been fun to improvise and work with children in the field.

### Résumé 

The conclusion is as it always is in live a little bit of everything. The time in Kazakhstan was definitely the most interesting I had in life so far. Work wise it could have turned out a little bit better. Masha did her best in giving us tasks we can accomplish and even made two work schedules, which we tried to follow as good as possible. I feel bad now, because I think I could have done more for the organization and they probably feel bad in giving me the wrong (or not enough?) tasks. At least this is how I read Mashas last words to me at our farewell party “I hope you learned something”. It seemed to me there was some guilt in those words. And I can assure you, Masha, I learned more then I could expect. Not only professionally I improved my skills in Illustration, Typography, Posterdesign and Photography drastically, but as a human I feel so satisfied that I finally got introduced to this culture. I am grateful for every person I met there. So many interesting characters, you really shaped me as a human being.
Thank you,
